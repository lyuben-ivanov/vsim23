## Video Tutorial with a Multiple Choice Quiz

The video below is part of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economic Lowdown 
Video Series. It uses the fictional economy of Econ Isle to explain how limited 
resources result in a scarcity problem for the economy. Econ Isleâ€™s production 
possibilities are graphed to show its frontier, and then used to discuss the 
opportunity costs of its production and consumption decisions. 

Please, watch the video and use the information in it to complete the quiz that
follows.

`r fontawesome::fa(name = "exclamation-circle")` _In the demo quiz above the first question is randomly sampled from a list of two different questions, while the second question uses the same phrasing but the words in quotes are randomly sampled from a vector of three possible options, effectively creating three similar but different questions (with different correct answers)._

## Randomly Generated Diagram and a Multiple Choice Question
```{r random_diagram_data}

qp1 <- sample(5:60, size = 1)
qp2 <- sample(5:30, size = 1)
```

```{r random_diagram}

ter::ppf_plot(
             x_axis_label = "Quantity of widgets", 
             y_axis_label = "Quantity of gadgets", 
             plot_point = TRUE, 
             quantity_of_product_1 = qp1, 
             quantity_of_product_2 = qp2
             )

```

```{r random_diagram_question}
